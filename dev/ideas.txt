= Project file format: =

File extension: .kiwi

Format?
  - Option 1: binary
  - Option 2: xml
  - Option 3: json

Ideas:
  - Contains tilesets and other graphics data (like object graphics) in the binary itself

    GOOD because it makes project files portable and self-contained
    BAD because you have to update tiles with file references anywa since a WIP map would
	change tiles a lot; this may not be an issue with live-update, though and would still
	make some sense
	BAD increased filesize
